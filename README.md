# Social-Anxiety-App

This app aims to help provide easy and free information and tools for young adults with social anxiety.
These include weblinks to various sites, a goal sysytem to encourage them to practice communicating with others, a diary feature to log thoughts and feelings and a breathing tool to use in stressful situations.

This app was developed for the University of Otago's COSC345 Software Development paper by Nathan Laing, Ethan Brake and Robert Giles.
